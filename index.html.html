        <h2>Ingredients you'll need:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>2</strong> pieces of bread</li>
            <li><strong>2</strong> pats of butter</li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> slice of monterey jack cheese</li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> slice of aged cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Process:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fetch yourself a fat-bottom skillet</li>
            <li>Heat the skillet over medium heat</li>
            <li>Butter one side of each slice of bread</li>
            <li>Place one slice of the buttered bread, buttered side down, into the skillet</li>
            <li>Quickly place each slice of cheese on the bread, being sure to cover the entire surface area</li>
            <li>Place the other slice of bread, butter side up, on top of the cheese</li>
            <li>Wait approximately <strong>1 to 2 minutes</strong> (or till the bread touching the skillet is a golden
                brown)</li>
            <li>Flip the sandwich over with some awesome pizazz and cook the other side till golden brown (approximately
                1 to 2 minutes)</li>
            <li>Eat with ketchup, or just enjoy the plain crispy goodness of your grilled cheese</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Note:</h3>
        <p>Grilled cheese is great on a grill, but for a quicker method, try using a clamshell panini press. The result
            will be much quicker, allowing you to make many more for you and your friends.</p>
